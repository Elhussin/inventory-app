# Inventory App

A simple inventory management application to track products, categories, stock levels and users. This README explains what the project does, how it works at a high level, and how to install, run and use it.

> Note: I wrote this README to be adaptable — if your project uses a particular framework (Express, Nest, Django, Rails, etc.), specific DB (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite), or a client (React/Vue), replace the generic commands below with your project's exact commands where needed.

## Project overview
Inventory App helps you manage items in stock, organize them into categories, and maintain user accounts and roles. Typical users: small shops, warehouses, or developers learning CRUD apps.

## Main features
- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) items
- Categories management
- Stock level tracking and simple adjustments
- User authentication (login/signup) and basic role support (admin/user)
- Search and filter items
- Export simple reports (CSV/JSON) — if implemented
- Optional: import items via CSV

## How it works (high level)
- Backend: REST API exposing endpoints for items, categories, users, and authentication.
- Database: relational DB stores items, categories, users and transactions/adjustments.
- Frontend: (if included) a web UI consumes the API to list and edit inventory.
- Typical flow: client -> API -> controllers -> services -> database (models) -> response.

## Requirements
- Node.js (>= 14) or the runtime your project uses
- npm or yarn
- A relational database (Postgres / MySQL / SQLite), or whichever your app uses
- Git

Adjust the versions above to match your project's requirements.

## Installation & getting started (local)
1. Clone the repository
   - git clone https://github.com/Elhussin/inventory-app.git
   - cd inventory-app

2. Install dependencies
   - npm install
   - or
   - yarn install

3. Create environment file
   - cp .env.example .env
   - Edit `.env` to set database credentials, JWT secret, and other config.

4. Database setup
   - Create the database referenced in your `.env`.
   - Run migrations and optional seeds (see next section).

5. Start the app (development)
   - npm run dev
   - or
   - yarn dev

6. Visit the app or use API endpoints (examples below).

## Environment variables (.env) — example
Create a `.env` file in the project root. Adapt names to your codebase.

PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database (example)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/inventory_db
# or separate values:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=user
DB_PASS=password
DB_NAME=inventory_db

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Other
LOG_LEVEL=info

## Database migrations & seeds
Your project likely includes a migrations system (Sequelize, TypeORM, Prisma, Django migrations, Rails migrations, etc.). Use the command the project provides:

- Example (Sequelize):
  - npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
  - npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

- Example (TypeORM):
  - npm run typeorm:migration:run

- Example (Prisma):
  - npx prisma migrate dev --name init
  - npx prisma db seed

If there is a `scripts` entry in package.json for migrations (e.g., `npm run migrate`), run that instead.

## Running (production)
- Build (if the project compiles):
  - npm run build
- Start server:
  - npm start
- Make sure environment variables for production are set, and the production database is migrated and seeded.

## Example API routes (replace with your actual routes)
These are common endpoints used by inventory apps — confirm the exact routes in your code.

- Auth
  - POST /api/auth/register — register new user
  - POST /api/auth/login — login, returns JWT

- Items
  - GET /api/items — list items (supports pagination, filters, search)
  - GET /api/items/:id — get a single item
  - POST /api/items — create a new item
  - PUT /api/items/:id — update an item
  - DELETE /api/items/:id — delete an item
  - POST /api/items/:id/adjust — adjust stock (increase/decrease)

- Categories
  - GET /api/categories
  - POST /api/categories
  - PUT /api/categories/:id
  - DELETE /api/categories/:id

- Reports/Export
  - GET /api/reports/inventory?format=csv

Authentication:
- Send Authorization: Bearer <token> header to protected routes.

## Testing
If tests exist:
- npm test
- or
- yarn test

Add or run unit/integration tests according to the project's test framework (Jest, Mocha, Pytest, etc.).

## Deployment tips
- Use environment variables provided by your host (Heroku, Render, Vercel, AWS).
- Ensure production DB is created and migrations are run before starting.
- Use secure JWT secret and HTTPS in production.
- Set proper CORS policies if frontend is hosted separately.

## Troubleshooting
- Database connection errors: check .env and that DB service is running.
- Migration errors: ensure migration tool version matches your setup.
- Missing env vars: check for required keys and provide defaults during development.

## Contributing
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
- Commit changes and push
- Open a pull request describing your changes

Please include tests for new features and follow existing code style.

## Next steps / improvements you might add
- Role-based permissions (admin / staff / viewer)
- Inventory transaction history (who changed stock + why)
- CSV import for bulk upload
- Reporting (low-stock alerts, monthly stock movement)
- Frontend UI if backend-only

## License
Add your project license here (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.). If you don't have one yet, consider adding an MIT license.

If you want, I can:
- tailor this README to the exact stack in your repo,
- add exact install/migrate/run commands by reading package.json and code,
- generate a `.env.example` with exact env keys,
- or create documentation for each API endpoint automatically.

Tell me which of those you'd like and I'll update the README accordingly.
